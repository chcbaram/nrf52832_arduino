/*
 * I2C
 *
 * Arduino Due is provided with two I2C interfaces:
 * - I2C0: on pin 20/21;
 * - I2C1: on pin 9/10.
 * The Wire library provides the following objects:
 * - Wire: to use I2C0;
 * - Wire1: to use I2C1.
 * ST Microelectronics' X-NUCLEO-IKS01A1 expansion board uses I2C on pin 9/10.

/* Definitions ---------------------------------------------------------------*/

/*
 * The Arduino two-wire interface uses a 7-bit number for the address, and sets automatically the last bit
 * depending on the action: 1 for reading and 0 for writing.
